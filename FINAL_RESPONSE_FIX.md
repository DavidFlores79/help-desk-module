# Response Submission - Final Fix

## Issue
Send Response button was not working - clicks were being blocked by z-index layering issues in the modal.

## Solution
Added explicit z-index management and pointer-events to ensure button is clickable:

```html
<div class="border-t border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 p-6 relative z-50">
  <form [formGroup]="responseForm">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3 relative z-50">
      <button
        type="button"
        (click)="submitResponse()"
        class="btn-primary relative z-50 pointer-events-auto"
        style="pointer-events: auto !important; position: relative; z-index: 9999;">
        Send Response
      </button>
    </div>
  </form>
</div>
```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Button is now clickable** - Added z-index: 9999 with pointer-events
2. ✅ **Form resets properly** - Clears textarea, FilePond, and checkbox
3. ✅ **No debug clutter** - Removed all console logs and test elements
4. ✅ **FilePond clears** - File upload resets after successful submission
