## 📝 Response Creation Fix

The 500 error when creating responses was addressed by:

1. ✅ Proper payload format (JSON for text-only, FormData for attachments)
2. ✅ Correct field names (`body` for message, `internal` for admin notes)
3. ✅ Proper `attachments[]` array format
4. ✅ Content-Type header management (automatic)
5. ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Payload formats:**

Simple response (JSON):
```json
{
  "body": "This is my response message"
}
```

Response with attachments (FormData):
```
body: "Message text"
attachments[]: [File1]
attachments[]: [File2]
```

Internal note (JSON):
```json
{
  "body": "Internal admin note",
  "internal": true
}
```

- ⏸️ **Awaiting User** - Waiting for user response
- ✅ **Resolved** - Issue resolved
- 🔒 **Closed** - Ticket closed

### Priority Options
- **Low** - Can wait
- **Medium** - Normal priority
- **High** - Important
- **Urgent** - Critical

## 🛡️ Security Features

- JWT token authentication
- HTTP-only cookies support
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection (via Laravel backend)
- Role-based access control
- Route guards
- API request validation

## 📊 Logging & Debugging

Comprehensive logging throughout the application:

- 🔄 Loading states
- 📤 API requests
- ✅ Success responses
- ❌ Error handling
- ⚙️ State changes
- 📋 Payload inspection

Console logs are prefixed with component/service names for easy identification.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### FilePond Styling
✅ **FIXED**: Imported FilePond CSS via `angular.json` to avoid import order issues.

### 500 Error on Response Creation
✅ **FIXED**: The backend expects specific payload formats. Ensured correct `body` field and proper FormData structure.

### Role Detection
✅ **FIXED**: Profile role is detected from `user.my_profile.name` field which contains "Administrador", "Usuario", or "SuperUser".

1. **Unit Tests** - Jest/Karma for components and services
2. **E2E Tests** - Cypress for critical user flows
3. **Storybook** - Component documentation
4. **Progressive Web App** - Offline support
5. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration
