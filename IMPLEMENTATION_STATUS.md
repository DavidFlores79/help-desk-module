## üî¥ Known Issues

### Critical
1. **Response Creation Returns 500 Error** - Backend Laravel/Symfony error:
   ```
   Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\JsonResponse::__construct() 
   must be of type string|null, array given
   ```
   - Frontend sends correct payload according to API spec
   - Backend controller appears to have a bug in response formatting
   - **This is a backend issue, not frontend**

### Role Detection
2. **Profile Role Mapping** - Currently detects roles by `my_profile.name`:
   - "Administrador" ‚Üí Admin
   - "Usuario" ‚Üí User
   - "SuperUser" ‚Üí SuperUser
   - Consider adding a `code` field for more reliable role detection
