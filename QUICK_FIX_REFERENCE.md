- Properly extracts `response.data.data` from paginated response

### ‚úÖ Assignment History Not Showing  
**Fixed:** Assignment history displays without errors
- Added safe navigation operators (`?.`)
- Fallback to 'Unknown' if user data missing
- No more "cannot read property 'name' of undefined" errors

### ‚úÖ Assigned To Field Empty
**Fixed:** Shows assigned user name
- Same safe navigation fix as assignment history
- Shows "Unassigned" if no assignment

### ‚úÖ Send Response Button Not Working
**Fixed:** Response submission works reliably
- Enhanced form validation before submission
- Marks fields as touched to show validation errors
- Better error logging for debugging
- Proper form reset after success

## Quick Test

1. **Login** at http://localhost:4200
2. **Go to ticket detail** (click any ticket)
3. **As Admin - Test Assignment:**
   - Click "Assign" button
   - See admin/superuser names in dropdown ‚úì
   - Select user and assign ‚úì
   - See "Assigned To" update ‚úì
   - See "Assignment History" appear ‚úì

4. **Test Response:**
   - Type message in "Add Response"
   - Click "Send Response" ‚úì
   - Response appears in list ‚úì
   - Form clears ‚úì

5. **Check Console** (F12):
   - Look for ‚úÖ success logs
   - Should see: "Admins/SuperUsers loaded: X of Y total"
   - Should NOT see any ‚ùå errors about undefined

## Files Changed

```
src/app/core/services/user.service.ts
  ‚Ü≥ Added filtering support and getAdminsAndSuperUsers()

src/app/features/ticketing/pages/ticket-detail-page/ticket-detail-page.component.ts
  ‚Ü≥ Fixed loadUsers(), submitResponse(), and template safe navigation
```

## Console Logs to Expect

**Good:**
```
‚úÖ [TICKET DETAIL] Admins/SuperUsers loaded: 5 of 23 total
‚úÖ [TICKET DETAIL] Ticket assigned successfully
‚úÖ [TICKET DETAIL] Response added successfully
```

**If Assignment Modal Empty:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [TICKET DETAIL] Admins/SuperUsers loaded: 0 of X total
‚ö†Ô∏è [TICKET DETAIL] No admin/superuser users found for assignment
```
**Fix:** Check user profiles in database are named 'Administrador', 'Admin', or 'SuperUser'

## API Endpoints Used

GET  /api/v1/tickets/{id}       ‚Üê Get ticket with assignments

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check browser console for detailed error logs
2. Verify API returns users with `my_profile` or `profile` object
3. Confirm user profiles have correct names in database
4. Check network tab to see actual API responses
5. Look for console logs starting with üîÑ, ‚úÖ, or ‚ùå

All issues should now be resolved. Application is running at http://localhost:4200
