## ⚠️ Known Issue

### Response Creation Returns 500 Error

**Problem:** Backend Laravel/Symfony error when submitting responses  
**Error:** `JsonResponse::__construct() must be of type string|null, array given`  
**Frontend Status:** ✅ Working correctly per API spec  
**Backend Status:** ❌ Needs fix  

**What works:**
- Frontend sends correct payload
- Validation works
- File upload component works
- Internal note flag works

**What doesn't work:**
- Backend returns 500 error
- Responses are not saved

**Solution:** Backend team needs to fix the JsonResponse constructor call in the ticket responses controller.
