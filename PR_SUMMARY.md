# Pull Request: Ticket Categories Refactor and UI Improvements

## Summary
This PR implements the ticket categories refactor as described in the API breaking changes documentation and adds several UI improvements.

## Changes

### API Breaking Changes Implementation
- ✅ Refactored ticket model to use `ticket_category_id` and `assignment_id` instead of `item_id` and `category_id`
- ✅ Added `TicketCategory` and `Assignment` interfaces
- ✅ Created `TicketCategoryService` for managing ticket categories
- ✅ Updated all DTOs (CreateTicketDto, UpdateTicketDto) with new fields
- ✅ Support for both camelCase and snake_case API responses

### New Features

#### 1. Ticket Categories Management Page (`/admin/categories`)
- View all active and inactive categories
- Create/Edit/Deactivate categories (UI ready, API pending)
- Accessible via Admin dropdown menu
- Fully translated (English & Spanish)

#### 2. Category Selection for Tickets
- **Admin dashboard**: Edit category directly from tickets table
- **Ticket detail page**: Edit category inline (admins only)
- Supports tickets without categories
- Loads all categories (active/inactive) to show existing selections
- Categories can be changed from multiple locations

#### 3. User Avatar & Dropdown Menu
- Circular avatar with user initials (gradient background)
- Dropdown includes Settings and Logout
- Mobile responsive design
- Settings moved from main menu to user dropdown

#### 4. Navigation Updates
- Admin dropdown with Dashboard and Ticket Categories options
- Cleaner navigation structure
- Settings removed from main menu bar

### Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed language selector to properly work with ngModel binding
- ✅ Fixed dropdown selection display using [selected] attribute
- ✅ Fixed ticket creation form validation (default priority: medium)
- ✅ Fixed category display in admin dashboard and ticket detail
- ✅ Fixed assigned user display in admin dashboard (handles both ID and object)

### Translations
- ✅ Added missing translations for file upload restrictions
- ✅ Added category management translations (EN & ES)
- ✅ Added `app.saving`, `app.actions`, `ticket.creating` translations
- ✅ Completed translation coverage for all user-facing text

## Technical Details

### Models Updated
- `Ticket` interface: Added `ticket_category_id`, `assignment_id`, `ticketCategory`, `assignment`
- `Ticket` interface: Removed `item_id`, `category_id`, `item`, `category`
- Added `TicketCategory` interface with full structure
- Added `Assignment` interface for item assignments
- `assigned_to` now supports both number and User object types

### Services Updated
- Created `TicketCategoryService` with `getTicketCategories()` and `getTicketCategory()`
- Updated `TicketService.buildFormData()` to use new field names

### Components Updated
1. **NewTicketPageComponent**
   - Uses TicketCategoryService
   - Removed item selection logic
   - Default priority set to 'medium'
   - Translated all labels and buttons

2. **TicketDetailPageComponent**
   - Added category dropdown for admins
   - Category changes saved immediately
   - Loads all categories (not just active)
   - Added `selectedCategoryId` property with ngModel

3. **TicketsPageComponent**
   - Updated to display `ticketCategory` instead of `category`
   - Shows user name (creator) for all tickets

4. **AdminPageComponent**
   - Added category column with inline editing
   - Uses Map to track selected categories per ticket
   - Loads categories on init
   - Added `getAssignedUserName()` helper method

5. **TicketCategoriesPageComponent** (NEW)
   - Full CRUD interface (API integration pending)
   - Modal forms for create/edit
   - Active/inactive status toggle
   - Fully translated

6. **HeaderComponent**
   - User avatar with initials
   - Dropdown menu with settings and logout
   - Admin dropdown menu
   - Settings removed from main navigation

7. **LanguageSelectorComponent**
   - Fixed to use FormsModule and ngModel
   - Properly tracks current language on reload
   - No longer shows success message (page reloads)

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Build completes successfully without errors
- ✅ Existing tickets display correctly
- ✅ Tickets without categories show "No category" / "N/A"
- ✅ Tickets with categories show correct category name
- ✅ Category can be changed from admin dashboard
- ✅ Category can be changed from ticket detail page
- ✅ New tickets can be created with category selection
- ✅ Language switching works properly
- ✅ User dropdown works on all pages
- ✅ Admin dropdown navigates correctly
- ✅ Translations work in both English and Spanish

## Notes

### API Readiness
- Ticket Category CRUD endpoints are ready in UI but show placeholder alerts
- Backend API implementation is pending (as requested)
- All GET operations work correctly

### Debugging
- Extensive console logging added for category selection
- Logs show: category loading, Map initialization, dropdown value retrieval
- Can be removed in future cleanup PR

### Compatibility
- Supports both `ticketCategory` (camelCase) and `ticket_category` (snake_case) from API
- Supports `assigned_to` as both number (ID) and User object
- Backward compatible with existing ticket data

## Migration Notes
For existing tickets in database:
1. Tickets with no `ticket_category_id` will show "No category" / "N/A"
2. Admins can assign categories from admin dashboard or ticket detail page
3. All active and inactive categories are available in dropdowns
4. No data migration required - works with existing data structure

## Files Changed
- **Core Models**: `ticket.model.ts`
- **Core Services**: `ticket.service.ts`, `ticket-category.service.ts` (new)
- **Features**: 5 component files updated, 1 new component
- **Shared Components**: `header.component.ts`, `language-selector.component.ts`
- **Translations**: `en.json`, `es-MX.json`
- **Routes**: `admin.routes.ts`
- **Documentation**: `TICKET_CATEGORIES_REFACTOR.md` (new)

## Related Issues

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Ensure backend API has new endpoints implemented
- [ ] Run database migrations if any
- [ ] Clear browser cache after deployment
