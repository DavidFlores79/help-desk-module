└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Services
1. **TicketService** - Complete CRUD operations
2. **AuthService** - Authentication & authorization
3. **UserService** - User management
4. **CategoryService** - Categories handling

### HTTP Interceptors Chain
```
Request → AuthInterceptor → Request
       → LoggingInterceptor → Log
       → HTTP Request
       
Response ← ErrorInterceptor ← Retry Logic
        ← LoggingInterceptor ← Log
        ← HTTP Response
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Response Creation 500 Error
**Problem:** Backend returned 500 error when creating responses.

**Root Cause:** Payload format mismatch. Backend expected `body` field, frontend was potentially sending wrong format.

**Solution:**
- Ensured JSON payload uses `body` field (not `message`)
- FormData properly formatted with `body` and `attachments[]`
- Added comprehensive logging for payload inspection
- Verified Content-Type headers (auto-managed by Angular)

**Current Status:** Working correctly ✅

### 2. ✅ FilePond Styling Issues
**Problem:** FilePond appeared unstyled or broken.

**Root Cause:** CSS import order conflicts with Tailwind.

**Solution:**
- Moved FilePond CSS imports to `angular.json`
- Removed @import from styles.css
- Registered FilePond plugins properly
- Added custom styling overrides

**Current Status:** Fully styled and functional ✅

### 3. ✅ Admin Role Detection
**Problem:** Warning "Could not determine admin status, no role or permissions found"

**Root Cause:** Looking for wrong field in user object.

**Solution:**
- Updated `isAdmin()` to check `user.my_profile.name`
- Checks for "Administrador" or "SuperUser"
- Added fallback logic
- Added comprehensive logging

**Current Status:** Working correctly ✅

### 4. ✅ Missing Features Implementation
**Problem:** Status change, resolve, reopen, close not implemented.

**Solution:**
- Added `changeStatus()` method to TicketService
- Added `changePriority()` method to TicketService
- Added status dropdown in ticket detail header (admin only)
- Added priority dropdown in ticket detail header (admin only)
- Added reopen functionality
- Added proper permission checks

**Current Status:** All features implemented ✅
