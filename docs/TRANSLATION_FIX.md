# Translation Fix - Spanish Labels

## Issue
Several labels were hardcoded in English and not showing in Spanish when the language was set to Spanish (es-MX) in settings:
- "Delete Ticket" 
- "View & Add Responses"
- "Responses" (in various places)
- Other labels in the responses modal

## Solution
Fixed all hardcoded English text by implementing proper internationalization (i18n) using the existing `TranslationService`.

## Files Modified

### 1. Translation Files
Added missing translation keys to both language files:

#### `src/assets/i18n/en.json`
- Added `ticket.deleting`: "Deleting..."
- Added `ticket.reopening`: "Reopening..."

#### `src/assets/i18n/es-MX.json`
- Added `ticket.deleting`: "Eliminando..."
- Added `ticket.reopening`: "Reabriendo..."

### 2. Component Files

#### `src/app/features/ticketing/pages/ticket-detail-page/ticket-detail-page.component.ts`
**Changes:**
- Imported `TranslationService`
- Injected `translationService` in the component
- Replaced hardcoded texts with translation keys:
  - "Back to Tickets" → `translationService.instant('ticket.backToTickets')`
  - "Delete Ticket" → `translationService.instant('ticket.deleteTicket')`
  - "Deleting..." → `translationService.instant('ticket.deleting')`
  - "Reopen Ticket" → `translationService.instant('ticket.reopenTicket')`
  - "Reopening..." → `translationService.instant('ticket.reopening')`
  - "Responses" → `translationService.instant('response.responses')`
  - "response" / "responses" → `translationService.instant('response.response')` / `translationService.instant('response.responses')`
  - "View & Add Responses" → `translationService.instant('response.viewAndAddResponses')`

#### `src/app/shared/components/responses-modal/responses-modal.component.ts`
**Changes:**
- Imported `TranslationService`
- Injected `translationService` in the component
- Replaced hardcoded texts with translation keys:
  - "Responses" → `translationService.instant('response.responses')`
  - "response" / "responses" → `translationService.instant('response.response')` / `translationService.instant('response.responses')`
  - "Close" → `translationService.instant('app.close')`
  - "No responses yet" → `translationService.instant('response.noResponses')`
  - "Be the first to respond to this ticket" → `translationService.instant('response.beFirst')`
  - "Internal Note" → `translationService.instant('response.internalNote')`
  - "Add Response" → `translationService.instant('response.addResponse')`
  - "Type your response here..." → `translationService.instant('response.typeResponse')`
  - "Response body is required" → `translationService.instant('response.bodyRequired')`
  - "Mark as internal note (only visible to admins)" → `translationService.instant('response.markAsInternal')`
  - "Sending..." → `translationService.instant('response.sending')`
  - "Send Response" → `translationService.instant('response.sendResponse')`
  - Error message → `translationService.instant('response.cannotAddResponse')`

## Existing Translation Keys Used
All translation keys were already present in both language files:
- `ticket.backToTickets`
- `ticket.deleteTicket`
- `ticket.reopenTicket`
- `response.responses`
- `response.response`
- `response.viewAndAddResponses`
- `response.noResponses`
- `response.beFirst`
- `response.internalNote`
- `response.addResponse`
- `response.typeResponse`
- `response.bodyRequired`
- `response.markAsInternal`
- `response.sending`
- `response.sendResponse`
- `response.cannotAddResponse`
- `app.close`

## Testing
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ All translation keys are present in both `en.json` and `es-MX.json`
- ✅ Spanish translations are properly configured:
  - "Delete Ticket" → "Eliminar Ticket"
  - "Deleting..." → "Eliminando..."
  - "Reopening..." → "Reabriendo..."
  - "View & Add Responses" → "Ver y Agregar Respuestas"
  - All response modal labels properly translated

## How to Verify
1. Run the application
2. Go to Settings and change language to "Español (México)"
3. Navigate to a ticket detail page
4. Verify all labels are now in Spanish:
   - "Volver a Tickets" (Back to Tickets)
   - "Eliminar Ticket" (Delete Ticket)
   - "Reabrir Ticket" (Reopen Ticket)
   - "Ver y Agregar Respuestas" (View & Add Responses)
5. Click on "Ver y Agregar Respuestas" button
6. Verify the modal shows all labels in Spanish:
   - "Respuestas" (Responses)
   - "Agregar Respuesta" (Add Response)
   - "Nota Interna" (Internal Note)
   - "Enviar Respuesta" (Send Response)
   - etc.

## Notes
- The application uses the `TranslationService` which loads translations from JSON files in `src/assets/i18n/`
- The default language is Spanish (es-MX)
- Language preference is stored in localStorage
- All changes are minimal and surgical, only replacing hardcoded strings with translation service calls
