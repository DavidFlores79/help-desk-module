## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Look for these logs:
✅ [TICKET DETAIL] Response added successfully
✅ [TICKET DETAIL] Ticket assigned successfully
✅ [FILE UPLOAD] FilePond initialized

// Red flags:
❌ [TICKET DETAIL] Failed to add response
❌ [TICKET DETAIL] Failed to assign ticket
```

### Check Network Tab
```
Successful requests:
✅ POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/responses → 200/201
✅ POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/assign → 200
✅ GET /api/v1/users → 200

Failed requests:
❌ 401 Unauthorized → Token expired, re-login
❌ 403 Forbidden → Insufficient permissions
❌ 500 Server Error → Backend issue
```

### Check FormData
If response submission fails, check console for:
```
📋 [TICKET DETAIL] FormData contents:
   body: "Test message"
   attachments[]: [File] test.jpg
```

Should have `body` field, NOT `message` field!
