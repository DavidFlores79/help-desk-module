# Features Implemented - Session Closure & Missing Functionality

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. Logout Functionality ✅
**Status:** Already Implemented  
**Location:** `src/app/shared/components/header/header.component.ts`

The logout button was already present in the header component with:
- Visual logout button with icon
- Calls `AuthService.logout()`
- Clears session (token + user data from localStorage)
- Redirects to `/auth/login`
- Works for both users and administrators

```typescript
logout(): void {
  console.log('🔐 [HEADER] User logging out');
  this.authService.logout();
}
```

### 2. Reopen Ticket Feature ✅ NEW
**Status:** Newly Implemented  
**API Endpoint:** `POST /v1/tickets/{id}/reopen`

#### Implementation Details:
- **Permission Logic:** Users can reopen their own tickets, admins can reopen any ticket
- **Conditions:** Only tickets with status `resolved` or `closed` can be reopened
- **UI Location:** Ticket detail page, shown conditionally
- **Confirmation:** Requires user confirmation before reopening
- **Behavior:** 
  - Increments `reopens` counter
  - Changes status back to `open`
  - Reloads ticket data after successful reopen

#### Code Added:
```typescript
canReopenTicket(): boolean {
  if (!this.ticket) return false;
  return this.ticket.status === 'resolved' || this.ticket.status === 'closed';
}

reopenTicket(): void {
  // Confirmation dialog
  // API call to ticketService.reopenTicket()
  // Success: reload ticket
  // Error: display error message
}
```

#### UI Component:
```html
@if (canReopenTicket()) {
  <button 
    (click)="reopenTicket()"
    [disabled]="isReopening"
    class="btn-secondary">
    🔄 {{ isReopening ? 'Reopening...' : 'Reopen Ticket' }}
  </button>
}
```

**Status:** Newly Implemented  
**API Endpoint:** `DELETE /v1/tickets/{id}`

  if (!this.ticket) return false;
  const currentUser = this.authService.getCurrentUser();
  if (this.authService.isAdmin()) return true;
  return currentUser?.id === this.ticket.user_id;
}

deleteTicket(): void {
  // Confirmation dialog with warning

  // Error: display error message
}
```

### 4. Internal Notes (Admin Only) ✅ NEW
**Status:** Newly Implemented  
**API Endpoint:** `POST /v1/tickets/{id}/responses` with `internal: true`

#### Implementation Details:
- **Permission:** Admin and SuperUser only
- **UI Location:** Response form in ticket detail page
- **Checkbox:** Only visible to admins
- **Display Logic:** Internal notes hidden from regular users
- **Visual Indicator:** Internal notes have blue background and lock icon

#### Code Added:

**Form Control:**
```typescript
responseForm = this.fb.group({
  message: ['', Validators.required],
  attachments: [[]],
  internal: [false] // Admin-only internal note checkbox
});
```

**Submission Logic:**
```typescript
const internal = this.responseForm.value.internal || false;

if (hasFiles) {
  // FormData submission
  if (internal) {
    formData.append('internal', '1');
  }
} else {
  // JSON submission
  payload = { body: messageText };
  if (internal) {
    payload.internal = true;
  }
}
```

#### UI Components:

**Checkbox (Admin Only):**
```html
@if (authService.isAdmin()) {
  <div class="mb-4">
    <label class="flex items-center gap-2 cursor-pointer">
      <input 
        type="checkbox" 
        formControlName="internal"
        class="w-4 h-4 text-primary-600"
      />
      <span class="text-sm font-medium">
        🔒 Mark as internal note (only visible to admins)
      </span>
    </label>
  </div>
}
```

**Display Filter:**
```html
@if (ticket.responses && ticket.responses.length > 0) {
  @for (response of ticket.responses; track response.id) {
    <!-- Only show internal notes to admins -->
    @if (!response.is_internal || (response.is_internal && authService.isAdmin())) {
      <div class="card" [class.bg-blue-50]="response.is_internal">
        <!-- Response content -->
        @if (response.is_internal) {
          <span class="px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold rounded-full bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800">
            🔒 Internal Note
          </span>
        }
      </div>
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔴 Known Backend Issue

### Response Creation 500 Error
**Status:** Backend Issue (Not Frontend)  
**Error:** `Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\JsonResponse::__construct() must be of type string|null, array given`

The frontend is sending the correct payload according to the API specification:
- **Text only:** JSON with `{ "body": "message text" }`
- **With attachments:** FormData with `body` field and `attachments[]` files
- **Internal flag:** Added as `internal: true` (JSON) or `internal: 1` (FormData)

**Example logs show correct frontend behavior:**
```
📤 [TICKET SERVICE] Adding response to ticket: 5
   Endpoint: http://bitacora-mantenimiento.test.com/api/v1/tickets/5/responses
   ✉️ Payload type: JSON (no attachments)
   📋 JSON payload: { "body": "Test response message" }
```

**Backend needs to fix:** The Laravel/Symfony controller is incorrectly formatting the JSON response, causing a type error.
