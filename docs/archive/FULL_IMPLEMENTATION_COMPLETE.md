## 🔐 Session Management Details

### How Logout Works

1. **User clicks Logout button** (in header)
2. **AuthService.logout() is called**
   ```typescript
   logout(): void {
     this.clearSession();           // Clear localStorage
     this.router.navigate(['/auth/login']);  // Redirect
   }
   ```
3. **Session is cleared**:
   - Removes `auth_token` from localStorage
   - Removes `auth_user` from localStorage
   - Updates `currentUser$` observable to null
   - Sets `isAuthenticated` signal to false
4. **User is redirected** to login page
5. **Auth guard blocks** access to protected routes

### Logout Locations

| Page | Logout Available | Location |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Login | ❌ No | N/A (not authenticated) |
| My Tickets | ✅ Yes | Header (top right) |
| New Ticket | ✅ Yes | Header (top right) |
| Ticket Detail | ✅ Yes | Header (top right) |
| Admin Dashboard | ✅ Yes | Header (top right) |

### Console Logs

When logging out, you'll see:
```
🔐 [HEADER] User logging out
🔐 [AUTH] Clearing session...
🔐 [AUTH] User logged out
```
