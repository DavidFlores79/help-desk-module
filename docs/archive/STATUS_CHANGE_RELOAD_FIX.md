# Status/Priority Change Reload Fix

## Issue
When changing ticket status or priority, the page would reload but responses and assignment history would disappear. This happened because the component was using the partial response data from the update API instead of reloading the complete ticket details.

## Root Cause
After changing status or priority, the component was updating `this.ticket` directly with the response data:

```typescript
this.ticketService.changeStatus(this.ticket.id, newStatus).subscribe({
  next: (response) => {
    this.ticket = response.data; // ❌ Partial data without responses/assignments
    this.isChangingStatus = false;
  }
});
```

The API response from status/priority update endpoints only returns the updated ticket object without the complete nested data (responses, assignments, etc.).

## Solution
Changed both `changeTicketStatus()` and `changeTicketPriority()` methods to reload the full ticket data instead of using the partial response:

```typescript
this.ticketService.changeStatus(this.ticket.id, newStatus).subscribe({
  next: (response) => {
    console.log('✅ [TICKET DETAIL] Status changed successfully:', response);
    this.isChangingStatus = false;
    // Reload the full ticket to get responses and assignment history
    this.loadTicket(this.ticket!.id); // ✅ Full ticket data with all relations
  }
});
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/app/features/ticketing/pages/ticket-detail-page/ticket-detail-page.component.ts`

#### Method: `changeTicketStatus()`
**Before:**
```typescript
next: (response) => {
  console.log('✅ [TICKET DETAIL] Status changed successfully:', response);
  this.ticket = response.data;
  this.isChangingStatus = false;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
next: (response) => {
  console.log('✅ [TICKET DETAIL] Status changed successfully:', response);
  this.isChangingStatus = false;
  // Reload the full ticket to get responses and assignment history
  this.loadTicket(this.ticket!.id);
}
```

#### Method: `changeTicketPriority()`
**Before:**
```typescript
next: (response) => {
  console.log('✅ [TICKET DETAIL] Priority changed successfully:', response);
  this.ticket = response.data;
  this.isChangingPriority = false;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
next: (response) => {
  console.log('✅ [TICKET DETAIL] Priority changed successfully:', response);
  this.isChangingPriority = false;
  // Reload the full ticket to get responses and assignment history
  this.loadTicket(this.ticket!.id);
}
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Responses are preserved after status changes
- ✅ Assignment history is preserved after status changes
- ✅ All ticket metadata is preserved (attachments, etc.)
- ✅ Ensures UI always displays complete and accurate data
- ✅ Consistent behavior with other update operations (already using loadTicket)
- ✅ Single source of truth for ticket data loading

## Related Methods Already Using This Pattern
The following methods were already correctly using `loadTicket()` to reload full data:
- `submitResponse()` - After adding a response
- `assignTicket()` - After assigning a ticket
- `reopenTicket()` - After reopening a ticket

This fix brings `changeTicketStatus()` and `changeTicketPriority()` in line with the established pattern.

## Testing
To verify this fix:

1. **Test Status Change:**
   - Create a ticket
   - Add a response to it
   - Assign it to a user
   - Change the status
   - Verify responses and assignment history are still visible

2. **Test Priority Change:**
   - Create a ticket with responses and assignments
   - Change the priority
   - Verify all data is preserved

3. **Test Multiple Changes:**
   - Change status, then priority, then status again
   - Verify data remains consistent throughout

## Technical Notes
- The `loadTicket()` method calls `getTicket(id)` which returns the complete ticket object with all relationships
- This approach is more reliable than trying to merge partial response data with existing ticket data
- The loading flag is cleared before calling `loadTicket()` to prevent UI flickering
